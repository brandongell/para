# Legal Document Organizer

An AI-powered legal document organizer that uses **Gemini multimodal AI** and **OpenAI GPT-4o** to automatically classify and organize legal documents with advanced PDF signature detection.

## 🎯 Key Features

- 🔮 **Gemini Multimodal PDF Extraction**: Revolutionary visual signature detection that finds ALL signers in PDFs
- 🤖 **Dual AI Classification**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o for document classification and metadata extraction
- 🧠 **Memory System**: Pre-indexes information for instant answers to business questions
- 📝 **Automatic Template Identification**: Intelligently identifies and categorizes template documents
- 📁 **Structured Organization**: Organizes documents into a 10-folder business function structure
- 👀 **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors folders for new files and organizes them instantly
- 📄 **Advanced PDF Processing**: Detects visual signatures, filled form fields, and annotations
- 🔄 **Batch Processing**: Can organize large numbers of existing files
- ⚡ **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy use
- 🤖 **Discord Bot**: Natural language document search and template requests
- 🔗 **Documenso Integration**: Upload templates to Documenso for e-signature workflows

## 🚀 What Makes This Special

This system uses **Google Gemini's multimodal capabilities** to analyze PDFs visually, not just as text. This breakthrough allows it to:

- ✅ **Find hidden signers**: Detects signatures that appear visual but aren't in the text layer
- ✅ **Extract complete metadata**: Names, addresses, emails, contract values, dates
- ✅ **Handle complex legal docs**: SAFE agreements, employment contracts, investment documents
- ✅ **Process annotations**: Stamps, form fields, electronic signatures

**Example Success**: On test document NMM.pdf, traditional extraction found only 1 signer (Dan Shipper), but Gemini finds both signers (Dan Shipper + Nashilu Mouen) with complete contact information.

## 🧠 Enhanced Memory System with Claude Code Search

The enhanced memory system captures comprehensive information from documents and aggregates it into searchable markdown files, now with Claude Code autonomous search capabilities:

### Core Memory Files:
- **Company Information**: EIN, addresses, formation details, milestones
- **People Directory**: Employees, contractors, advisors, investors with contact info
- **Financial Summary**: Total capital raised, investment rounds, SAFE agreements, financial impact analysis
- **Revenue & Sales**: Customer contracts, revenue streams, business context, payment terms, obligations
- **Contracts Summary**: Active contracts, expiring soon, business context, key provisions, obligations
- **Key Dates**: Contract expirations, renewal deadlines, vesting schedules

### Enhanced Information Capture:
The system now extracts and preserves:
- **Business Context**: 3-5 sentence narratives explaining strategic importance and implications
- **Key Terms**: 5-15 most important contractual provisions and conditions
- **Obligations**: All specific deliverables, milestones, and requirements
- **Financial Terms**: Payment schedules, pricing models, revenue shares, minimum commitments
- **Critical Facts**: Document-specific information like EIN numbers, policy numbers, addresses

### 🤖 Claude Code Autonomous Search (NEW):
When you ask a question, Claude Code:
1. **Searches memory files** for quick answers
2. **Identifies information gaps** and what's still needed
3. **Reads full documents** to extract missing details
4. **Continues searching** until it finds complete answers
5. **Provides comprehensive responses** with source citations

Example: "How much has Austin Rief invested?" → Claude finds the amount in memory, then reads the full SAFE agreement to extract valuation cap, discount rate, and other terms.

Memory files are automatically updated when new documents are added and enable instant detailed answers via Discord.

## 📝 Template Identification & Documenso Integration

The system automatically identifies template documents using intelligent pattern matching:

- **High Confidence**: Documents with [BLANK], [FORM], (Form), or Template in filename
- **Medium Confidence**: Generic documents without specific party names
- **Smart Exclusion**: Won't mark EXECUTED or signed documents as templates

### 🆕 Automatic Documenso Upload Prompt

When you upload a template file to Discord, Para automatically detects it and offers to upload it to Documenso for e-signature workflows. Just reply "yes" to upload!

When a template is detected and Documenso is configured, the system will:
1. **Prompt you** to upload the template to Documenso
2. **Upload the document** if you confirm
3. **Return a configuration link** to set up signature fields
4. **Update metadata** with Documenso document ID and URL

Example prompt:
```
🎯 Template Document Detected!
📄 File: Employment Agreement [FORM].pdf
📋 Type: Employment Agreement
🏷️  Category: People_and_Employment
🔍 Confidence: HIGH

🤔 Would you like to upload this template to Documenso for configuration? (yes/no): yes

📤 Uploading template to Documenso...
✅ Template uploaded successfully!
🔗 Configure your template here:

```

Templates are:
- Automatically categorized with status: "template"
- Organized into the 09_Templates folder
- Searchable via Discord with natural language
- Tagged with metadata including placeholders and use cases

### Metadata Schema
Each organized document gets a companion `.metadata.json` file with:
```json
{
  "filename": "document.pdf",
  "status": "executed",
  "category": "Investment_Fundraising",
  "signers": [
    {"name": "Dan Shipper", "date_signed": "2023-06-15"},

  ],
  "primary_parties": [...],
  "effective_date": "2023-06-15",
  "contract_value": "$50000",
  "governing_law": "Delaware",
  "template_analysis": {
    "is_template": false,
    "confidence": "HIGH",
    "indicators": ["specific party names", "executed"]
  }
}
```

For templates:
```json
{
  "filename": "Employment Agreement [BLANK].pdf",
  "status": "template",
  "template_analysis": {
    "is_template": true,
    "confidence": "HIGH",
