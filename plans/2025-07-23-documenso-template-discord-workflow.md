# feat: Discord-triggered Documenso Template Workflow with Conversational Field Collection

## Overview

Implement a sophisticated Discord bot workflow that enables users to send legal document templates for signature through natural language commands. The bot will engage in a conversational flow to collect required field values before creating and sending documents via Documenso API. This feature transforms Para from a document organizer into an active document workflow automation system.

## Problem Statement

Currently, the legal document organizer can identify templates and upload them to Documenso, but there's no way to actually use these templates to create documents for signature. Users need to manually:
1. Go to Documenso web interface
2. Find the template
3. Fill in field values
4. Add recipient information
5. Send for signature

This manual process defeats the purpose of having templates integrated with our automated system. Users want to trigger document creation directly from Discord with a simple command like "send the MNDA to john@example.com" and have Para handle the entire workflow.

## Proposed Solution

Build a comprehensive Discord-triggered workflow that:
1. Recognizes template usage requests in natural language
2. Identifies the requested template from metadata
3. Fetches template field requirements from Documenso
4. Engages in a conversational flow to collect field values
5. Validates collected information
6. Creates a document from the template with filled values
7. Sends the document for signature
8. Tracks document status in our metadata system

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

The solution requires enhancements across multiple layers:

```
Discord Message → NLP Intent Recognition → Template Matcher
                                               ↓
                                    Documenso Template Fetcher
                                               ↓
                                    Field Collection Workflow
                                               ↓
                                    Document Creation Service
                                               ↓
                                    Signature Request Sender
                                               ↓
                                    Metadata Status Tracker
```

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: [Foundation - Template ID Tracking]

**Tasks and Deliverables:**
- Enhance metadata schema to store Documenso template IDs
- Update template upload process to capture and store template IDs
- Create template registry service for quick lookups
- Implement template matching algorithm for natural language requests

**Success Criteria:**
- All templates have associated Documenso template IDs in metadata
- Templates can be found by various natural language patterns
- Template registry provides O(1) lookup by common names

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

#### Phase 2: [Core Implementation - Conversational Workflow Engine]

**Tasks and Deliverables:**
- Create `TemplateWorkflowService` to manage multi-step conversations
- Extend `ConversationContext` to track workflow state
- Build field collection state machine
- Implement field value validation and parsing
- Create interruption and cancellation handlers

**Success Criteria:**
- Bot can maintain multi-turn conversations for field collection
- Users can cancel or restart workflows at any point
- Field values are validated according to type (email, date, text, etc.)
- Workflow state persists across Discord restarts

**Estimated Effort:** 4-5 days

#### Phase 3: [Integration - Documenso API Enhancement]

**Tasks and Deliverables:**
- Extend `DocumensoService` with template field retrieval
- Implement `getTemplateFields()` method to fetch required fields
- Add `createAndSendDocument()` method for complete workflow
- Handle recipient management and signing order
- Implement error handling and retry logic

**Success Criteria:**
- Service can fetch all template fields and their metadata
- Documents are created with proper field values
- Recipients receive signing invitations
- Errors are gracefully handled with user feedback

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

#### Phase 4: [Polish & User Experience]

**Tasks and Deliverables:**
- Create intuitive conversation prompts with examples
- Build progress indicators using Discord embeds
- Implement field collection with smart defaults
- Add confirmation step before sending
- Create help system for template workflows

**Success Criteria:**
- Users can complete workflows without confusion
- Clear visual feedback at each step
- Smart suggestions reduce typing
- Help available at any workflow stage

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

## Alternative Approaches Considered

1. **Web-based Form Interface**
   - Pros: Rich UI, easier field collection
   - Cons: Breaks Discord-first workflow, requires additional infrastructure
   - Rejected: Goes against Para's chat-first philosophy

2. **Single-Message Field Collection**
   - Pros: Faster for power users
   - Cons: Error-prone, hard to validate, poor UX for complex templates
   - Rejected: Conversational approach more intuitive and flexible

3. **Slash Commands with Parameters**
   - Pros: Structured input, Discord-native
   - Cons: Limited to 25 options, can't handle dynamic fields
   - Rejected: Too restrictive for variable template fields

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Technical Dependencies
- Documenso API v1 with template support
- Discord.js for bot interactions
- Node.js async/await for workflow orchestration

## Risk Analysis & Mitigation

### High Risk: Documenso API Changes
- **Impact**: Breaking changes could halt workflows
- **Mitigation**: Version lock API, monitor changelog, implement adapter pattern

### Medium Risk: Complex Template Fields
- **Impact**: Some templates may have fields we can't handle conversationally
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple templates, build field type library gradually

### Medium Risk: Discord Rate Limits
- **Impact**: Rapid interactions could hit limits
- **Mitigation**: Implement message queuing and rate limiting

### Low Risk: Workflow State Loss
- **Impact**: Users lose progress in field collection
- **Mitigation**: Persist state to database, implement resume functionality

### Implementation Notes

**Conversational Flow Example:**
```
User: Send the MNDA to john@example.com
Bot: I'll help you send the Mutual NDA template. Let me gather the required information.

**Recipient Details**
✅ Email: john@example.com
What is the recipient's full name?

User: John Smith
Bot: **Company Information**
What is the disclosing party's company name?

User: Acme Corp
Bot: **Agreement Details**
What is the purpose of this NDA? (e.g., "Discussion of potential partnership")

User: Evaluating potential acquisition
Bot: **Review & Confirm**
📄 Document: Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement
👤 Recipient: John Smith (john@example.com)
🏢 Disclosing Party: Acme Corp
📝 Purpose: Evaluating potential acquisition

Ready to send? (yes/no)

User: yes
Bot: ✅ Document sent successfully!
🔗 Track status: https://app.documenso.com/documents/12345
📧 John Smith will receive an email to sign the document.
```

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. Use thread-based conversations for workflow isolation
2. Implement field collection as a state machine for maintainability
3. Store workflow state in ConversationContext with TTL
4. Use Discord embeds for rich formatting and progress indication
5. Validate fields progressively to catch errors early

**AI Implementation Considerations:**
- Leverage GPT for natural language template matching
- Use AI to suggest field values based on context
- Implement smart defaults from historical data
- Consider AI-powered validation for freeform text fields
